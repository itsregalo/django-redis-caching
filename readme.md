# What is Redis?

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a caching engine. Since it keeps data in RAM, Redis can deliver it very quickly. Redis is not the only product that we can use for caching. Memcached is another popular in-memory caching system, but many people agree that Redis is superior to Memcached in most circumstances. Personally, we like how easy it is to set up and use Redis for other purposes such as Redis Queue.
